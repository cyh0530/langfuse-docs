We're excited to introduce **search functionality** for prompts in Langfuse prompt management!

Finding specific prompts in your collection is now much easier with the new search bar, allowing you to quickly locate the prompts you need without scrolling through long lists.

## What's New?

The new search functionality includes:

- **Quick Search**: A prominent search bar at the top of the prompt management interface
- **Real-time Results**: Search results update instantly as you type
- **Comprehensive Matching**: Search across prompt names, descriptions, and content

## How to Use It

Using the new search feature is simple:

1. Navigate to **Prompt Management** in your Langfuse dashboard
2. Use the search bar at the top of the page
3. Type any part of the prompt name, description, or content you're looking for
4. Results will filter in real-time to show matching prompts

This enhancement makes it significantly easier to manage large collections of prompts and find exactly what you need when building and iterating on your LLM applications.
